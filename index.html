            The ability of AI systems to understand human feelings enables them to be more compatible with our emotional being, informing higher quality interactions with us and hence better service towards our goals. In this paper, we explore the role of affective language in the form of conversation grounded on visual stimuli in informing human decisions about their emotion. To this end, we collected a new dataset, dubbed AffectVisDial, of 48,587 10-turn dialogs as well as concluding emotion attributions and dialog-informed textual explanations, resulting in a total of 26,110 hours working hours. The dialog starts with an image and two emotion opinions about the image (one positive and one negative). Then two participants, a Questioner and an Answerer, are instructed to have a conversation through which the Questioner ( can not see the image) asks questions to the Answerer for the purpose of deciding how they feel about it. In the end, we asked both the Questioner and Answerer to provide the emotion they felt and an explanation of what in the conversation informed their decision. Building on AffectVisDial, we comprehensively study the Affective Visual Dialog task through two skills: (1) Dialogbased Question Answering: the skill of generating the last answer in the conversation or at an arbitrary turn given the dialog history and the image. We also introduce (2) Dialog-based Emotion classification and Affective explanation: the skill of predicting the emotion class and corresponding affective explanation based on the dialog history for the Questioner or the dialog history combined and the image from the Answerer. We demonstrate and train solid Affective Visual Dialog baselines adapted from state-of-the-art models. Remarkably, the responses generated by our models show promising emotional reasoning abilities in response to visually grounded conversations. The dataset and code will be made publicly available, and we hope that Affective Visual Dialog serves as a conversational test for machine emotional intelligence.

              <p> Sadness: The man's facial expression makes me think of the taboo of having your image taken, as if he thinks that he or the painter are unworthy of it. It reminds me of the general moral discomfort of the past.</p>
