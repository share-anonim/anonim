            The ability of AI systems to understand human feelings enables them to be more compatible with our emotional being, 
            informing higher quality interactions with us and hence better service towards our goals. In this paper, we study the role 
            of affective language in the form of conversation grounded on visual stimuli in informing human decisions about 
            his/her emotion. Toward this goal, we collected a new dataset, dubbed AffectVisDial, of 30800 dialogs of 10-turns 
            as well as concluding emotion attributions and dialog-informed textual explanations, resulting in a total of 
            15781 hours working hours. The dialog starts with an image and two emotion opinions about the image (one positive and one negative). 
            Then two participants, a Questioner and an Answerer , are instructed to have a conversation through which the Questioner
             ( can not see the image) asks questions to the Answerer for the purpose of deciding how he/she feels about it. 
             In the end, we asked both the Questioner and Answerer to provide the emotion they felt and an explanation of what 
             in the conversation informed their decision. Building on AffectVisDial, we comprehensively study the Affective 
             Visual Dialog task through two skills: (1) Dialog-based Question Answering: the skill of generating the last answer 
             in the conversation or at an arbitrary turn given the dialog history and the image ( similar to the typical visual dialog setting). 
             We also introduce (2) Dialog-based Emotion classification and Affective explanation: the skill of predicting the emotion 
             class and corresponding affective explanation based on the dialog history for the Questioner or the dialog history combined
              and the image from the Answerer. We train and demonstrate strong Affective Visual Dialog baselines adapted from 
              state-of-the-art models. Remarkably, the responses generated by our models how promising emotional reasoning abilities 
              in response to visually grounded conversations. The dataset and code will be made publicly available, and we hope that 
              will help ease future affective vision research and that Affective Visual Dialog serves as a test for machine emotional intelligence.

              <p> Sadness: The man's facial expression makes me think of the taboo of having your image taken, as if he thinks that he or the painter are unworthy of it. It reminds me of the general moral discomfort of the past.</p>
